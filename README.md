# My website

This version of the site added the blog made with Wordpress. Accidentally I deleted it, so I lost everything that was stored in the database (in particular some images).

A dynamic website, multilingual, written with PHP.
In contrast with the previous version, it used extensively heredoc
strings containing the
 two versions (English and Italian) of the parts of the site.
