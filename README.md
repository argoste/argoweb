# ArgoSte website PLan

# Brainstorming #

Please read and update frequently the [to-do-list](TODO.md).

## Choose an URL ##

My current homepage can be reached at [argo3.altervista.org](http://argo3.altervista.org).

A slightly better address can be [lateriz.altervista.org](http://lateriz.altervista.org).

A lot better will be to have a registered domain. (How much it costs?).

## Site structure proposal A ##

This is a [_scaletta_](#note03).

- homepage
  - activities [note](#note01)
    - single-activities aka the projects I launch
      - bago
      - meucci
      - lateriz-devices
      - cad drawings
      - themes
      - appunti-informatica (a byproduct of other activities)
  - blog
    - expositions, conferences, other events
    - project launches
    - adventurer's log [note](#note2)
  - credits
  - about me

<!--- long-running activities can correspond to the-hats-i-wear
  - electrician,  - bricoleur  - developer  - sysadmin  - essay writer
  -->
## I write down some example of pages ##

An exposition I visited, a travel I made. A project I want to advertise. A thought I want to share. My notes (a walk-through) on a technology.  

## Site structure proposal B ##

I need to decide if organize stuff into sections or as loose pages with tags and/or categories.

A section (a folder) for every long-running project or activity. Then Each page has a category () and can have tag.

~~~yaml
categories: [event, diy, study, ]
tags: []
~~~

## technology change

I used to have two simple sites made with valilla PHP and a Wordpress blog. Try to join the content to a website made with a static site generator. I choose to use [phpoole](http://phpoole.org); here [my notes](phpoole_in_a_hurry.md).

## Notes ##

<a id="note00"> I use the word Activity, project, endeavour, enterprise to mean the same thing.  I found this definition on [Wiktionary](wiktionary.org)<q>project (1): A planned endeavour, usually with a specific goal and accomplished in several steps or stages.</q></a>

<a id="note01"> can the activities duality be explained in terms of vertical or horizontal subdivision? At least write a conventional parlance.</a>

<a id="note02">as life is an adventure</a>

<a id="note03">The Italian word _scaletta_ can mean a <abbr title="table of contents">toc</abbr> you write before writing the actual content. It is a plan for an article, or for any written stuff. It is a _wanted_toc_.</a>
